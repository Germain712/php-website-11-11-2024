# PHP for Beginners
Download XAMPP from - https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/

Install in APPLICATIONS/XAMPP/htdocs/

Inside htdocs created a new folder named - website - This is where I saved my file.

In the top right corner of your browser (three lines or three dots, depending which browser you use) click then go to settings, then click on extensions, and add live server extension. Then add the server address (in this case http://localhost/website/) & live server address (in vscode click Go Live, then copy & paste the live browser address into the extension field and click APPLY)

Open file in vscode.
